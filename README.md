# Ogier's dogfights

A number of dogfights (mostly, disguised coop, Zuti-style) for the FAFG Squad

Those missions are made for a french speaking squadron, and I don't take the time to translate them. Feel free to do so.

- Fight Club : a basic dogfight, with most planes and some land targets. Not balanced.
- frontale : a very raw mission with incoming HE111
- Jabo FW : Russian side, your base is under attack. Possibility to retaliate afterwards. Note that the attack starts when the first player materialises.
- Kuban Demo : simply Kuban landscape, no military mission
- Les cruches attaquent : unfinished mission with attacking jugs.
- Les panzers attaquent : panzers are advancing toward our base.
